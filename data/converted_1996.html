<p>In general, at the Institute, the word Course</p>
<p>(capitalized) refers to an organized curriculum</p>
<p>leading to a specified degree. The word</p>
<p>course (lower-case) or subject refers to the in-</p>
<p>dividual class. Each Course is designated by a</p>
<p>number or letter abbreviation; each individual</p>
<p>subject offered by a Course is also numbered.</p>

<p>Guide to Subject Listings</p>
<p>The descriptions in this chapter are subject to</p>
<p>change. The final list of subjects to be offered</p>
<p>in 1996-97 is published with the class</p>
<p>schedules booklet prior to the beginning of</p>
<p>each term.</p>
<p>On the World Wide Web, see</p>
<p>http://registrar.mit.edu/ for an integrated,</p>
<p>searchable subject listing/schedule.</p>
<p>The following are examples of undergraduate</p>
<p>and graduate subject listings. Each subject list-</p>
<p>ing consists of three parts: the subject name,</p>
<p>subject information, and subject description.</p>
<p>Subject Name</p>

<p>The former number of a renumbered subject</p>
<p>is indicated in parentheses below the first</p>
<p>horizontal line.</p>
<p>Same subject as appears in parentheses fol-</p>
<p>lowed by the subject's other number(s) if the</p>
<p>subject is joint or SWE. Meets with appears if</p>
<p>the subject is taught together with one or more</p>
<p>different-level subjects, or if part of the subject</p>
<p>is taught in conjunction with another subject.</p>
<p>Prerequisite subjects, if any, are listed, or the</p>
<p>prerequisite is described. Numbers in italics in-</p>
<p>dicate corequisites - prerequisite subjects</p>
<p>that may be taken simultaneously with the sub-</p>
<p>ject described. If there are no prerequisites or</p>
<p>corequisites, a dash (-) appears. Pre-</p>
<p>requisites may be waived by the instructor in</p>
<p>charge for particularly well-qualified students.</p>
<p>Year offered may state Acad Year 1996-97:</p>
<p>Not offered or Acad Year 1997-98: Not of-</p>
<p>fered. There is no comment if the subject is of-</p>
<p>fered in both academic years 1996-97 and</p>
<p>1997-98.</p>
<p>Subject level and term follow. U is an under-</p>
<p>graduate subject, and G is a subject primarily</p>
<p>for graduate students. IAP is MIT's Inde-</p>
<p>pendent Activities Period.</p>
<p>Credit units, which indicate a subject's time</p>
<p>distribution, are represented by three numbers</p>
<p>separated by dashes. The number of units as-</p>
<p>signed for recitation and lecture is first; for</p>
<p>laboratory, design, or fieldwork second; and</p>
<p>for preparation, third. Add all of the units</p>
<p>together to obtain the total credit for a subject.</p>
<p>One unit represents approximately 14 hours of</p>
<p>work. Units arranged indicates that units are</p>
<p>specially arranged by the instructor.</p>
<p>Subjects fulfilling the General Institute Require-</p>
<p>ments, such as BIOLOGY, PHYSICS, CALC,</p>
<p>CHEMISTRY, REST (Restricted Electives in</p>
<p>Science and Technology, formerly SCI DIST),</p>
<p>Institute LAB, or HASS-D (Humanities, Arts,</p>
<p>and Social Sciences Distribution) are so desig-</p>
<p>nated to the right of the credit units.</p>
<p>HASS indicates subjects that can be used to</p>
<p>satisfy the Humanities, Arts, and Social Scien-</p>
<p>ces Requirement (other than HASS-D sub-</p>
<p>jects).</p>
<p>HASS-D Language Option indicates lan-</p>
<p>guage subjects which may be substituted for</p>
<p>one HASS-D subject.</p>
<p>[P/D/F] appears to the right of the credit units</p>
<p>if the subject is graded on a P, D, or F basis</p>
<p>(where P means C or better performance).</p>
<p>H-LEVEL Grad Credit indicates an approved</p>
<p>subject for higher graduate-level degree credit.</p>
<p>In some cases, a message follows the designa-</p>
<p>tion indicating that the subject is H-level in cer-</p>
<p>tain departments.</p>
<p>Can be repeated for credit appears under</p>
<p>the credit units if the subject can be taken</p>
<p>more than once for academic credit.</p>
