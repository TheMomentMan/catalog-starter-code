Guide to Subject Listings

The descriptions in this chapter are subject to
change. The final list of subjects to be offered
in 1996-97 is published with the class
schedules booklet prior to the beginning of
each term.

On the World Wide Web, see
http://registrar.mit.edu/ for an integrated,
searchable subject listing/schedule.

The following are examples of undergraduate
and graduate subject listings. Each subject list-
ing consists of three parts: the subject name,
subject information, and subject description.

Subject Name

The subject name consists of its number and
title, and appears above the first horizontal line.

ses.

G. M. Brown, J. Stubbe

J at the end of a subject number indicates that
this subject is offered jointly by more than one
department. The subject numbers of the other
departments are indicated in the Subject Infor-
mation section following the phrase Same
subject as.

(New) below the subject number and title indi-
cates a subject offering that is new to the
catalogue. (Revised Units) or (Revised Con-
tent) below the subject number and title indi-
cates a change from the previous catalogue.

J. R. Munkres

The former number of a renumbered subject
is indicated in parentheses below the first
horizontal line.

Same subject as appears in parentheses fol-
lowed by the subject's other number(s) if the
subject is joint or SWE. Meets with appears if
the subject is taught together with one or more
different-level subjects, or if part of the subject
is taught in conjunction with another subject.

Prerequisite subjects, if any, are listed, or the
prerequisite is described. Numbers in italics in-
dicate corequisites — prerequisite subjects
that may be taken simultaneously with the sub-
ject described. If there are no prerequisites or
corequisites, a dash (—) appears. Pre-
requisites may be waived by the instructor in
charge for particularly well-qualified students.

Year offered may state Acad Year 1996-97:
Not offered or Acad Year 1997-98: Not of-
fered. There is no comment if the subject is of-
fered in both academic years 1996-97 and
1997-98.

Subject level and term follow. U is an under-
graduate subject, and G is a subject primarily
for graduate students. IAP is MIT’s Inde-
pendent Activities Period.

Credit units, which indicate a subject's time
distribution, are represented by three numbers
separated by dashes. The number of units as-
signed for recitation and lecture is first; for
laboratory, design, or fieldwork second; and
for preparation, third. Add all of the units
together to obtain the total credit for a subject.

¢

One unit represents approximately 14 hours of
work, Units arranged indicates that units are
specially arranged by the instructor.

Subjects fulfilling the General Institute Require-
ments, such as BIOLOGY, PHYSICS, CALC,
CHEMISTRY, REST (Restricted Electives in
Science and Technology, formerly SCI DIST),
Institute LAB, or HASS-D (Humanities, Arts,
and Social Sciences Distribution) are so desig-
nated to the right of the credit units.

HASS indicates subjects that can be used to
satisfy the Humanities, Arts, and Social Scien-
ces Requirement (other than HASS-D sub-
jects).

HASS-D Language Option indicates lan-
guage subjects which may be substituted for
one HASS-D subject.

[P/D/F] appears to the right of the credit units
if the subject is graded on a P, D, or F basis
(where P means C or better performance).

H-LEVEL Grad Credit indicates an approved
subject for higher graduate-level degree credit.
In some cases, a message follows the designa-
tion indicating that the subject is H-level in cer-
tain departments.

Can be repeated for credit appears under
the credit units if the subject can be taken
more than once for academic credit.

noted at the end of its description. If the sub-

ject description does not appear, the number

of the subject under which the description ap-
pears is given.

The name of the instructor(s) in charge as
known at the time of publication is listed in
italics, or the name of the departmental con-
tact is listed in regular type.
